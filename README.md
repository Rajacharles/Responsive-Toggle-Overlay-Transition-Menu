In the latest web trends, we can discover a lot of fullscreen navigation menus. Most of such menu doesn’t come with the hamburger icon. So,  here I’ll build a fullscreen overlay menu with a hamburger toggle button using CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.

It is responsive and works well with small to large devices. Such type of overlay navbar handle through toggle button and when to click, it will open and cover all the page with the transparent color full background.
